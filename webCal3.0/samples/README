webCal version 3.0

Install
-------------------------------------------------------------
To install, give the command 'make' in this directory.
To test, cd to 'samples' and give the command

  ../webCal CalSourceA

This will create the file calendar.html.  Open it in your
browser.  Note that it depends on calstyle.css, and note that
this .css file is different than previous versions.


Changes
-------------------------------------------------------------
There are a number of improvements / changes to previous webCal
versions.  Here are a few:

1. Dates are /-formatted and, by default, are month-first.  So,
   for example, 5/25/2020.

2. As long as at least one date has already appeared in full in
   your input file, you can leave the year off and it will be
   deduced.

3. There is an "Options:" block that's used for setting some
   things, like the stylefile, and outputfile.

4. To a large extent, the order of the tagged blocks is irrelevant.
   As an exception, I would make sure the DateRange: tag appears
   before other blocks that include dates.  The only real reason
   for this is so that other dates can be truncated by leaving the
   year off.

5. IMPORTANT! Patterns for Topics: can have repeated occurrences
   of days. So, for example, I might use MMRR for my summer school
   lectures.

7. IMPORTANT! You may now add a "Modifications:" block, which
   allows you to change Topics patterns for a day.  For example,
   if 5/26/2020 would normally be a lab day, and I wanted to use
   two lectures instead, I would do:


   Modifications:
     5/26/2020 lec lec
   :endModifications:

   NOTE: this requires another new feature, which is that "Topics:"
         blocks can be given an id --- in this case I am assuming
	 that my lecture topics block has the id "lec", which is
	 what you'll see in the sample calendar CalSourceA
